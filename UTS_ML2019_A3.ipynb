With increase of competition, companies started building algorithms to give personalized recommendation based on user's likes. Organization started giving offers to lure customers so that they remain with the service/product/process. This has opened vast option for the internet users to choose from. This is the reason, sometimes customers leave the service and jump to other service providers. It is a threatening situation if we see it from business aspects. That is the reason, it becomes important to predict customer churns so that organization can make necessary changes in the product/process and keep the company growth steady.  \n",
