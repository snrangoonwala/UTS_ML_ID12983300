        "From 1990s, the usage of internet started growing exponentially. It allowed the internet users to explore the world by sitting infront of machine. E-commerce started growing during this era. As per the figure(1), from 1999 to 2007 the number of users started  growing. With increase of competition, companies started building algorithms to give personalized recommendation based on user's likes. Organization started giving offers to lure customers so that they remain with the service/product/process. This has opened vast option for the internet users to choose from. This is the reason, sometimes customers leave the service and jump to other service providers. It is a threatening situation if we see it from business aspects. That is the reason, it becomes important to predict customer churns so that organization can make necessary changes in the product/process and keep the company growth steady.  \n",

The fundamental of e-commerce is to eliminate middle men and supply goods directly to the buyers from vendors. \n",

Therefore, the importance of the organization depends in understanding client's expectation and requirement from the service providers. To attract the customers, the venture offers promotion codes, customized offers, rebates to the customers and keep the clients loyal to the venture. If the offer is given to all the customers then it will be loss for the organizations.
